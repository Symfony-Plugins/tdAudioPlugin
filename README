tdAudioPlugin
=============

Provides easy interface for flash mp3 player to embed in symfony projects.

This plugin is a part of __TD CMS__ and is based on __Doctrine ORM__.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository by executing the following
command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdAudioPlugin/trunk plugins/tdAudioPlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install -s beta tdAudioPlugin

as the actual release is in its beta stage. Run

    $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

to enable all needed media files (which in this case are more or less
everything).

Usage
=====

  * Enable the __track_td_album__ module in your backend app and enable the
    __tdSampleAudio__ module in your frontend (or make a copy of it to modify,
    if the plugin was installed using SVN).

  * Fixtures are provided with the plugin - more than 10 small mp3 files (thanks
    to  [simplythebest.net](http://www.simplythebest.net) site). Run following
    commands:

        $ ./symfony doctrine:build --all

    and

        $ ./symfony doctrine:data-load

    Now you have to create upload directories for audio and cover files:

        $ mkdir web/uploads/td/audio web/uploads/td/cover

    and make it writeable:

        $ chmod 777 web/uploads/td/audio web/uploads/td/cover

    Now you have to copy the mp3 sample files from _tdAudioPlugin/data/samples_
    to the audio upload directory created above. Everything is ready to run the
    following URL in your browser:

        http://your-project/audio

    to see a demo of the mp3 flash player. It should look something like this:

    ![Album_tracks](http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2228/tdaudioplugin2.png "Album tracks")

    (those screenshots have been made from an example website).

  * To use the activate/deactivate AJAX interface in the backend td_track_album
    module, remember to enable the __graphics__ module of the __tdCorePlugin__
    inside your settings.yml file (see tdCorePlugin README).

        [php]
        enabled_modules: [ ..., graphics ]

Configuration
=============

You can modify settings of the tdAudioPlugin in the
__config/tdAudioPluginConfiguration.class.php__ file:

  * _td_audio_upload_dir_ - upload dir of all audio files

Translations
============

You may translate tdAudio module to your own language by creating
__td.XX.xml__ file under _modules/tdSampleAudio/i18n_
directory (where XX is the language code). So far, English language is the
default one and additionally Polish translationis provided.
